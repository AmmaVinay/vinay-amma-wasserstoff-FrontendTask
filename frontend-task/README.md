## 6. Approach to the Task:
- To create a user interface using Next.js, I began by thoroughly understanding the design requirements provided by Wasserstoff. I structured the project with a focus on modularity and maintainability, using Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and consistent design. Initially, I faced challenges with animations using React Reveal, which led me to switch to Framer Motion for better integration and smoother performance. I implemented carousels and state management to dynamically display events and collections. Continuous testing and refinement ensured a polished, user-friendly interface that met all specified requirements.
